    <p>I like this one first off for the <b>color</b> scheme, which i feel is really on point for her style and her brand. Leading with a video or Live photo is a really interesting touch in how the viewer (me) sees the website. The straight down alignment is also really easy on the eyes for simple viewing.</p>

<p>I like this website for all the reasons that its different than the first. It IS hard on the eyes which might bring her own personality to life based on the photo of herself she chose. She seems outside the box, and the portfolio website shows that.</p>

<p>This personal portfolio starts out with a killer splashpage, that really draws me into the site. The way the website is laid out really makes it simple to navigate, different than the simplicity of the straight up and down column structure of the first example, but still nice.</p>
